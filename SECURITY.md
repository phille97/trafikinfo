## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**

The way to report a vulnerability is through the **[private vulnerability reporting feature on GitHub](https://github.com/phille97/trafikinfo/security/advisories/new)**. This method ensures the report is securely delivered directly to the project maintainers.
